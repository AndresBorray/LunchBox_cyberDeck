# LunchBox_cyberDeck

This is my Lunchbox Cyber Deck. It runs on Raspberry Pi 4, Linux (Raspbian OS...64 bit of course), and I use it primarily for coding on the couch and browsing the web. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions (andresfborray@gmail.com) or if you plan on building one yourself. Lastly, this project was inspired by Jay at Back7.co, I highly suggest you check out his work; you'll thank me later. 

I've added  the STL/ OBJ files that I created so you can 3d Print yourself a Cyber Deck Lunchbox. Keep in mind, these specs are for the Nanuk 904 but you could easily resize them. I used FreeCAD and TinkerCAD for most of the 3D modeling work. If you're building your own, please keep me posted or tag me on twitter or email me. 

Update (June 26, 2020): Well this is awesome...my build was featured on Hackaday! Thank you Kristina Panos for taking the time to write about it! Check out the write-up here! <https://hackaday.com/2020/06/09/lunchbox-cyberdeck-is-a-tasty-build/>

FAQ

1. Can I buy one? 
I've received some emails from folks asking if I could build them a CyberDeck. I'd be happy to do a few commissions, depending on how much time I have. You can send me an email at andresfborray@gmail.com. I recommend trying to build one if you have time though, it was a great learning experience. 

2. Where did this idea come from? 
The original designer that inspired me is Jay D. at Back7.co. If you're planning on building your own cyber_deck please check out his blog and great build; it will be extremely helpful.

3. What in the hell is that keyboard and how do you use it?  
It's called The Gherkin and it was created by the good folks at 40percent.club. It's a 30% ortho-linear keyboard (buttons are in a grid, not staggered). The bottom row of keys give you access to different layers when you hold them. The two orange keys are backspace and space. So for example, if I want to get to the second layer, where the top row is all numbers, I would long press the backspace key to open up layer 2 and then the first row of the keyboard would allow me to type numbers (Q = 1, W=2, etc.). It takes some getting used to but I suggest printing out a keymap that you can reference for the first few weeks. Soon you'll catch yourself not needing to look at the map as it engrains itself in your cortex as muscle memory. 

4. What supplies did you use? 
They're listed on my website at <https://www.andresborray.com/post/lunchbox-size-cyberdeck>
The 3D print files can be found on tinkerCAD, also linked in the original blog post.
